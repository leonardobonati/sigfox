# Send on duty cycle
Send data to the Sigfox cloud through Radiocrafts modem.

Fixed-length packets are generated by the Texas Instruments CC2650 LaunchPad microcontroller and sent to the Radiocrafts modem every 9 seconds.
They are then sent by the microcontroller to the Radiocrafts RC-1692-HP-SIG Sigfox modem through a UART connection.
Finally, data are transmitted by the modem to the Sigfox cloud through the Sigfox network using a Hop-by-Hop Reliability (HHR) protocol.
